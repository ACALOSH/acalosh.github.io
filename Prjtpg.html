                    <p style="padding: 20px; padding-top: 40px;">The Centre for Speckled Computing is a research group based at the University of Edinburgh. Their team has developed bluetooth heart rate and air pollution sensors that have been used glpbally for partnered research projects with unversities such as Imperial, ITT in Dehli and Harvard.
                        For clinicians and users to interact with said sensors a phone application was created called the AirRespeck App. However this app was poorly deisgned and many people found it difficult to use, which made it hard to collect data properly. I was hired to redesign the UX and UI of the app as well as re-program of the entire phone application itself.

                               Once the prototype was approved, I started on programming the front end of the new app using Android Studio. Once it was completed, I created a tutorial video to showcase the redesign and to help learn how to preform basic functions.

                                Some of our research, including a partnership project with the nhs, focuses on a more senior demographic of patients so we made sure to include a comfort mode. This, combined with the overall redesign should improve usability for clinicians and participants.

                        For a masters course I was tasked with creating a dynamic website that would explore social spaces in Edinburgh. 
                        I decided to make a website that would allow users to create, collaborate and share fridge magnet poetry. 
                        Using Javascript, I created a script to generate random words and affect the background color of the website based on the date, time and weather in . This creates an unique experience for users to consider the context in which they are creating or exploring the website.
                         Using PHP I created a backend to a database to help store said poetry for users to view their own poetry and share with others.

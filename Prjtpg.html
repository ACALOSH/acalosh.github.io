                    <p style="padding: 20px; padding-top: 40px;">The Centre for Speckled Computing is a research group based at the University of Edinburgh. Their team has developed bluetooth heart rate and air pollution sensors that have been used globally for partnered research projects with institutions such as Imperial, NHS Borders and Harvard.
                        For clinicians and users to interact with said sensors, a phone application was created called the AirRespeck App. However this app was poorly deisgned and many people found it difficult to use, which made it hard to collect data properly. I was hired to redesign the UX and UI of the app as well as re-program of the entire phone application itself.

                                Some of our research, including a partnership project with the nhs, focuses on a more senior demographic of patients so we made sure to include a comfort mode. This, combined with the overall redesign should improve usability for clinicians and participants.

                                The dashboard of Speckled Computing is main tool for researchers to view the data they are collecting and to view the status of the sensors that are being used in their project. However, the range of research being conducted and the types of data being collected is vast. Some projects focus on air pollution and it's affects on health, other's focus on rehabilitating patients with respitaory illnesses and other projects focus on the machine modeling of the data collected. This creates a huge difference in what data is important to each project.
                                For my dissertation I explored the design challenge of creating a web hub that provides visualisations that allows researchers from a multitude of projects to dynamically view their data in a context-driven form. This web page generates graphical representations that will be relevant to any researcher using speckled sensors, no matter what kind of research they are working on.

                            <p style="padding-left: 0; padding-top:5%">
                                To determine what visualisations were most relevant to a researcher I first dissected what kind of data each project was potentially gathering to figure out the domainspace of the data i was working with. With three possible sensors for each project, (airspeck portable, airspeck stationary, and respeck) there were a multitude of variables being collected such as temperature, particle matter levels, heart rate and activity level. Once I had gathered all possible values, I then looked at all the potential combinations of data that could potentially be made into visualisations (steps vs temperature, heart rate vs particle matter). This was done within a sensors data collections and between sensors as well. From there redundant or irrelavant visualisations were eleminated. The remaining were sorted by percieved usefulness with heuristics such as data-richness being taken into account while sorting. The list was then split by sensor data (data pertaining to just the respeck data or airspeck data being seperated while mixed data was given its own group).

                        For a masters course I was tasked with creating a dynamic website that would explore social spaces in Edinburgh. 
                        I decided to make a website that would allow users to create, collaborate and share fridge magnet poetry. 
                        Using Javascript, I created a script to generate random words and affect the background color of the website based on the date, time and weather in . This creates an unique experience for users to consider the context in which they are creating or exploring the website.
                         Using PHP I created a backend to a database to help store said poetry for users to view their own poetry and share with others.

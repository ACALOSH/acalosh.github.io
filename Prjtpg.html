                    <p style="padding-left: 0%">The Centre for Speckled Computing is a research group based at the University of Edinburgh. Their team has developed bluetooth heart rate and air pollution sensors that have been used glpbally for partnered research projects with unversities such as Imperial, ITT in Dehli and Harvard.
                        For clinicians and users to interact with said sensors a phone application was created called the AirRespeck App. However this app was poorly deisgned and many people found it difficult to use, which made it hard to collect data properly. I was hired to redesign the UX and UI of the app as well as re-program of the entire phone application itself.

                    <p>
                        For a masters course I was tasked with creating a dynamic website that would explore social spaces in Edinburgh. 
                        I decided to make a website that would allow users to create, collaborate and share fridge magnet poetry. 
                        The words generated for users are dependent on the time and weather in edinburgh as a way to emphasise the way our environment influences our creative processes.
